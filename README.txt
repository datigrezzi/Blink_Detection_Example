In this folder there is an R script (blink_detection_example.R), a sample data set (pupil_data_sample.tsv) and two PNG files. If you open the R script by double clicking it, the working directory in R should be set directly to the containing folder.

The blinks.R file is required to run the example. If you are online, the script will fetch it directly from github, It can also be downloaded at: https://github.com/datigrezzi/rGaze/blob/master/blinks.R

In the example I use the pupil diameter data for the left eye; the same procedure can be applied for the right eye.
